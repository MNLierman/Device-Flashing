# Device Flashing
##### Collected Information & Research on Flashing Network Devices, Routers, IoT Devices, Phones, Tablets
Welcome, I'm an IT Professional and owner of a IT services company (> Invise Solutions) where we support clients in many industries. Here, I organize and share detailed information and research on flashing various devices, including NAS devices, routers, IoT devices, and more. My published work focuses on recovering, upgrading, and improving these devices through scripts and modifications of the software that these deivces run on. Of particular focus is any devices running Linux.

#### Purpose and Value
This repository is designed to help anyone looking to enhance the performance of their devices (most common types listed above), modify the software they run, or recover data from failing or failed systems. While the work I've published here may be tailored to specific devices, **much of what I've published is universally applicable**. If your system resembles those I've documented, **you can likely adapt the processes and scripts I've created to fit your needs**. Feel free to comment and share what you're working on!

The methods I've documented are often crucial for my clients, as they allow me to:

* Recover data from malfunctioning devices.
* Upgrade or improve device performance.
* Ensure devices are running the most secure and efficient firmware.
  
#### How You Can Help
* Let me know in the comments, discussions, or in my Discord channel if you have any research or scripts to donate that directly can help the devices/projects I'm working on (or others that need help).
* If you have old networking devices, such as NAS devices, QNAP systems, or any devices running ARMv7 or higher, please consider donating them to my research. Your contributions will support ongoing projects and help me continue providing valuable services to clients.

#### Support My Work
If you find my work valuable, please consider making a donation. Your support will enable me to keep this repository up-to-date and continue helping others with their device recovery and upgrade needs.

### WD MyCloud (All Generations)
#### How To Unbrick WD MyCloud & How to Recover Data from WD MyCloud (Older versions, including RAID 1-bay or 2-bay)
Recent client in which the RAID on their MyCloud crashed, all MyClouds are configured with hardware or software RAIDs. Essentially, their MyCloud was bricked, and since RAIDs can be complicated and sometimes require enourmous amounts of time, that can make it even more frustrating for people. If you lost the data, a data recovery center may charge you thousands. To note, it may seem obious, but WD does not support the older MyClouds and the Debian 7 OS anymore. Thankfully there is some information out there on reflashing and unbricking the MyCloud devices, thanks to some of that information, I have built onto that and found my own utilties, tricks, and tools to make this a much easier process. For this client, it turned out to be a OS crash, but these steps work for any scenario on the WD My Clouds, gen 1, gen 2, and gen 3. I moved all these instructions and steps I took to a separate page > [WD MyCloud Unbrick and Data Recovery Using Telnet Notes](/WD%20MyCloud%20Unbrick%20Recovery%20(using%20Telnet).md).
