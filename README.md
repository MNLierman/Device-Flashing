# System-Flashing

This is a repo where I am organizing information and research about various systems, such as NAS devices, routers, IoT devices, or anything else running linux, which I've successfully recovered, upgraded, or improved through flashing. This is primarily necessary for clients, where I end up needing to flash systems to different firmware or ugprade the existing firmware, when upgrading or replacing the hardware isn't viable at the moment. Flashing may also be necessary for me to recover their data.

If you stumble upon this and have old networking devices, such as NAS devices, QNAP, anything running armv7 or higher, feel free to donate it to my research, as this is a necessary projects for clients as I come across devices that I need to flash for some reason.

### WD MyCloud
#### How To Recover Data from WD MyCloud RAID (1-bay or 2-bay)
Recent client in which their RAID crashed, WD does not support their Debian 7 OS anymore. It turned out to be a OS crash, but these steps work for any scenario on the WD My Clouds, gen 1, gen 2, and gen 3. I moved all these instructions and steps I took to it's own page [here](/wd-mycloud-unbrick-raid-recovery-telnet).
